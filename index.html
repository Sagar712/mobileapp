          Vishal Wankhade overflow-wrap and word-break behave very similarly and
          can be used to solve similar problems. A basic summary of the
          difference, as explained in the CSS specification is: overflow-wrap is
          generally used to avoid problems with long strings causing broken
          layouts due to text flowing outside a container. word-break specifies
          soft wrap opportunities between letters commonly associated with
          languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). After describing
          examples of how word-break can be used in CJK content, the spec says:
          “To enable additional break opportunities only in the case of
          overflow, see overflow-wrap“.
          <br /><br /><br />
          From this, we can surmise that word-break is best used with
          non-English content that requires specific word-breaking rules, and
          that might be interspersed with English content, while overflow-wrap
          should be used to avoid broken layouts due to long strings, regardless
          of the language used.
          <br /><br />
          The Historical word-wrap Property overflow-wrap is the standard name
          for its predecessor, the word-wrap property. word-wrap was originally
          a proprietary Internet Explorer-only feature that was eventually
          supported in all browsers despite not being a standard.
          <br /><br />
          word-wrap accepts the same values as overflow-wrap and behaves the
          same way. According to the spec, browsers “must treat word-wrap as an
          alternate name for the overflow-wrap property, as if it were a
          shorthand of overflow-wrap“. Also, all user agents are required to
          support word-wrapindefinitely, for legacy reasons.
          <br /><br /><br />
          Both overflow-wrap and word-wrap will pass CSS validation as long as
          the validator is set to test against CSS3 or higher (currently the
          default).
